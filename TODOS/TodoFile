## 22 esfand procedure:
    check initialization in system performance.
    check gradient flow (it should be only the last charcter)
























# 30 bahman todo
 1. feed data to network






























#11 Bahman TODO list:

1. search Farajitabar's code for hawks and poisson process implementation,
2. search for library of hawks and poisson process implementation,
identify 2 phase of implementation
1. parameter learning,
2. measure of MAE using parameter.




1. why MAE is bad in data -> visualize what is bad,
   how this measure is weak in your implementation? ->
   locate what happens in data, with this measure which part of
   data is estimated in a worse manner.


   is this beacuse of the outlier ?
   if we lower the gradient of outliers, is this helpful or not ?




2. should we worry about learning?
   visualize learning in Tensorflow. -> report it. analyze it,
   check analysis with Dr
